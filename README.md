## Testing the Fixes

1. **Clear Browser Storage**: Clear localStorage and sessionStorage
2. **Test Login Flow**: 
   - Navigate to `/login`
   - Should show loading briefly, then login form
   - Login should redirect to dashboard smoothly
3. **Test Dashboard Access**:
   - Should load dashboard data properly
   - No infinite loading states
4. **Test Logout Flow**:
   - Logout should redirect to login page
   - No loading loops

## Debugging

The app now includes console logs to help debug authentication issues:
- Check browser console for auth state changes
- Look for "AuthMiddleware" and "auth-store" logs
- Verify initialization sequence

## Key Changes Made

- `lib/auth-store.js`: Added initialization state and improved auth checking
- `components/AuthMiddleware.jsx`: Fixed race conditions and added proper loading states
- `app/login/page.jsx`: Added initialization checks and improved redirect logic
- `app/page.jsx`: Fixed main page routing
- `app/layout.jsx`: Added ClientProviders
- `lib/api.js`: Improved error handling
- `lib/client-providers.jsx`: New file for global initialization

## Environment Setup

Make sure your backend API is running on `http://localhost:4000` or set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable.

## Running the Application

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The admin portal should now handle authentication flows smoothly without loading issues.
